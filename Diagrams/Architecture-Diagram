Here's a brief description of each component:

Client Interface: Represents the users or applications interacting with the backend system.

Load Balancer: Distributes incoming requests from clients to the server to ensure efficient use of resources and scalability.

Server: The central part of the system where the application logic resides.

Queue System: Manages each client's requests in a separate queue, allowing for efficient processing and handling of concurrent requests.

Worker Processes: Background processes responsible for processing requests from the queue, performing tasks such as data processing, validation, and storage.

Database: Stores data such as user information, processed requests, and other relevant data.
